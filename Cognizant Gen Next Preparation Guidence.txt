Congrats on clearing to the next round! üéâ Being shortlisted is already a big win. Now it‚Äôs time to prepare smartly and thoroughly‚Äîespecially because your assigned cluster (Cluster 3: C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) has a defined scope and you‚Äôll likely face both web + backend + algorithmic questions.

I dug into past interview / experience reports and combined that with general best practices. Here‚Äôs a detailed roadmap + sample questions + strategy to help you crack the Gen Next technical interview.

---

## What past interviewers report ‚Äî key takeaways & patterns

From reports on GeeksforGeeks, PrepInsta, Reddit, etc.:

* The technical assessment rounds often include **2‚Äì3 coding problems**, along with **SQL / database queries**, and **web UI tasks (HTML/CSS/JS)**. ([GeeksforGeeks][1])
* Many candidates mention that **C# + SQL** questions together account for ~85% of weight in cluster 3. ([KN Academy Jobs][2])
* In web UI parts, tasks involving **form validation, responsive nav bar, dynamic DOM manipulation, simple components (accordion, image gallery)** appear frequently. ([Scribd][3])
* Interviewers also probe **OOP principles, data structures, complexity, and code design**. ([GeeksforGeeks][4])
* HR / behavioral rounds ask standard ‚Äútell me about projects, strengths/weaknesses, where do you see yourself, challenges, leadership, etc.‚Äù ([PREP INSTA][5])
* In a few reports, candidates got asked to debug or modify existing HTML/CSS/JS code during the interview. ([GeeksforGeeks][6])
* Some struggled when their cluster contained languages they were weak in (e.g. ‚ÄúI don't know anything about C# but my cluster required it‚Äù) ([Reddit][7])

So, the consensus is: be strong both in **backend logic / algorithms in C# + SQL** and **frontend UI/web skills with HTML/CSS/JS**. Also, design your code cleanly‚Äîreadability and correctness matter.

## Suggested topics & concept checklist

Here‚Äôs a combined list of topics to cover. Use this as a checklist to track what you‚Äôve mastered vs what you need to revise.

## Sample / common questions (based on past interviews)

Here are representative questions (from reports) you should practice:

1. **C# / general backend / OOP**

   * What is the difference between class and interface in C#? ([Scribd][8])
   * Explain method overloading vs method overriding ([Scribd][8])
   * What is a delegate? What is an event in C#? (sometimes asked)
   * What is the difference between `==` and `Equals()` or reference equality vs value equality
   * How does garbage collection work in .NET / what is IDisposable / using statements
   * What is LINQ? Give an example of filtering a list using LINQ
   * Implement a function that returns the nth Fibonacci number (iteratively & recursively)
   * Given an array of integers, find pairs that sum to a given value
   * Reverse a string / check palindrome

2. **Data Structures & Algorithms**

   * Sort a string or list of strings, or sort an integer array (quick sort / merge sort)
   * Find the duplicate in an array where numbers are from 1 to N
   * Two-sum (given an array find two numbers that sum to target)
   * Move zeros to end in an array
   * Maximum subarray sum (Kadane‚Äôs algorithm)
   * Check balanced parentheses in a string
   * Depth-first / breadth-first traversal (basic tree)

3. **SQL / Database**

   * Query to find second highest salary from employee table
   * Query to fetch duplicate records
   * Query with joins: find order details with customer info
   * Group by + having: find customers with > 5 orders
   * Subquery: select employees whose salary > average salary
   * Create table statements with constraints

4. **HTML / CSS / JS / Web UI**

   * Create a responsive navigation bar (hamburger menu)
   * Validate a form (email, password, required fields) using JavaScript
   * DOM manipulation: dynamically add/remove list items
   * Image carousel / slider implementation
   * Accordion / tabs UI using JS
   * Given some HTML + CSS + JS code, find bugs or fix alignment
   * Explain event bubbling / capturing, stopPropagation, preventDefault
   * What is `this` in JS? How is it determined?
   * Difference between `==` and `===` in JS
   * Promises / async-await usage
   * Fetch / AJAX call to get JSON, and render it in DOM

5. **Behavioral / HR**

   * Tell me about yourself
   * Explain your project in depth (choose one)
   * What difficulties you faced and how you overcame
   * Why this company / why this role
   * If offered another role, will you accept?
   * Strengths and weaknesses
   * Leadership / teamwork example
   * Where do you see yourself in 5 years

## How to structure your preparation & timeline

Here‚Äôs a suggested plan (say you have ~10‚Äì14 days until interview):

| Days      | Focus Areas                  | Strategy                                                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Day 1‚Äì2   | Brush up core C# & OOP       | Revisit basics, read tutorials, write small programs             |
| Day 3‚Äì5   | Data structures & algorithms | Solve ~2 problems per day; focus on arrays, strings, sorting     |
| Day 6‚Äì7   | SQL & database               | Practice SQL queries from sample problems                        |
| Day 8‚Äì9   | Web UI (HTML/CSS/JS)         | Build mini projects, solve UI coding tasks                       |
| Day 10    | Integration / mock tests     | Simulate full technical assessment (C# + SQL + Web UI)           |
| Day 11    | Debugging & reading code     | Take code snippets, debug or enhance them                        |
| Day 12    | Behavioral + mock interviews | Practice explaining your projects, answering HR questions        |
| Day 13‚Äì14 | Revision & rest              | Quick revision of formulas, syntax, mental readiness, sleep well |

When practicing, always time yourself and simulate constraints. Also **write clean, modular code with comments**. In interviews, explain your thought process out loud‚Äîstructure, edge cases, complexity.

---

## Tips & strategies during interview

* Read the question carefully; clarify input format, edge cases, constraints.
* First talk about your approach / pseudocode before writing code.
* Use meaningful variable names.
* After coding, test with edge cases (empty, single-element, max/min values).
* If time is short, write a partial correct solution and explain how you'd complete it.
* In web tasks, pay attention to cross-browser / responsive behavior.
* Always ask clarifying questions if the prompt is ambiguous.
* In behavioral round, use STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format for answers.
* Be honest: If you don‚Äôt know something fully, say so ‚Äî but maybe show how you'd approach learning it or partially solve it.
