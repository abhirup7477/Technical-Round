1. Technical Prep (Most Important)

Since your resume highlights SQL, C/C++, Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, React/Next.js, you should expect questions in these areas:

a) Core CS Subjects (from your coursework section)

Data Structures & Algorithms → Stack, Queue, Linked List, Sorting, Searching.

DBMS & SQL → Joins, Normalization, Primary vs Foreign Key, Write SQL queries (Top N, Group By, Joins).

OOPs → Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism (with examples in Java/C#/Python).

OS → Deadlock, Scheduling algorithms, Virtual memory basics.

Computer Networks → TCP vs UDP, OSI layers, HTTP vs HTTPS.

b) Project-based Questions

Blood Bank Management System → Be ready to explain:

Why TypeScript over plain JS?

How you handled data management?    

Deployment process on Vercel.

JavaScript Mini Projects → They might ask:

How LocalStorage works.

How you structured code for modularity.

🔹 2. Coding Prep

Be ready to solve simple-medium coding problems in interview:

Reverse a string/linked list.

Find duplicates in an array.

SQL: “Find highest salary employee per department.”

Since you solved coding well in assessment, expect 1–2 coding questions live.

🔹 3. HR & Behavioral

Introduce yourself (resume-based → education + projects + skills).

Why Cognizant? (Answer: “Global exposure, training opportunities, GenC program for skill growth”).

Strengths/weaknesses.

Teamwork or conflict-handling example (football/cricket hobby can help here).

“Where do you see yourself in 5 years?” → Say something like “growing into a skilled full-stack developer, contributing to large-scale projects”.

🔹 4. Last-Minute Brush Up

Revise basics of C#, SQL joins, OOPs, and JS concepts since you mentioned weak JS in test.

Check your GitHub projects—sometimes they’ll ask you to walk through the code.

Review common interview puzzles (like swapping numbers without temp, palindrome check).
